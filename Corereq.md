# Core Requirements Document: Fitness Community Marketplace Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the core requirements for a comprehensive marketplace platform designed to enable fitness community organizers to create, manage, and monetize their communities. The platform serves as an end-to-end solution for grassroots fitness organizations—including running clubs, yoga circles, recreational sports leagues, and boutique fitness groups—providing essential tools for event management, membership administration, payment processing, and community engagement.

The platform addresses a significant gap in the fitness industry infrastructure, where community-led fitness organizations currently rely on fragmented tools such as messaging applications, spreadsheet software, and peer-to-peer payment services. By consolidating these functions into a single, purpose-built platform, we enable organizers to focus on community growth while providing members with a streamlined discovery and participation experience.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Market Context

The grassroots fitness movement represents a substantial and growing segment of the fitness industry, encompassing diverse activities from running clubs and pickleball groups to outdoor yoga sessions and CrossFit communities. However, the current infrastructure supporting these organizations is fragmented and inefficient.

### Key Market Insights

- **Community Demand:** Over 40% of adults report they would exercise more frequently if they had access to a fitness community (CDC survey data).
- **Market Size:** The global sports and fitness club industry exceeds $90 billion annually (IBISWorld), yet community-led fitness remains significantly under-monetized.
- **Operational Challenges:** Organizers lack integrated tools to effectively manage memberships, process payments, schedule events, and scale their communities.

### Current State Limitations

Existing solutions require organizers to cobble together multiple tools:
- Communication platforms (WhatsApp, Facebook Groups)
- Administrative tools (Google Sheets, Excel)
- Payment processing (Venmo, PayPal, bank transfers)
- Event management (scattered calendar invites, social media posts)

This fragmented approach creates administrative overhead, reduces revenue capture, and limits scalability.
